# $root_dir - a directory where files are available for download through nginx.
#
# Example:
#   Let's create a file and a symlink to it in $root_dir;
#   echo privet > /tmp/test.txt; ln -s /tmp/test.txt /usr/www/sites/pbxcore/files/cache/test.txt;
#   The symlink will be destroyed after 5 minutes.
#
# Example 2:
#   Let's create a file and a symlink to it in $root_dir;
#   echo privet > /tmp/temp-test.txt; ln -s /tmp/temp-test.txt /usr/www/sites/pbxcore/files/cache/test.txt;
#   Both the symlink and the file will be destroyed after 5 minutes.
#   If the file name contains "/temp-", it will also be removed.
