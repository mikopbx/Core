## How to modify your system
For some easy customisations, you can use a dialplan application point on a menu. The *dialplan applications* supports PHP-AGI or Asterisk Dialplan language.

Or direct system file customisation on the web interface.

MikoPBX usually loads from read-only *offload* partition. If you want to change something in the core module, you should remount the partition to *write mode* with a console (SSH) command **remount-offload**

If you want to add some new functionality, we strongly advise you look at [ModuleTemplate](https://github.com/mikopbx/ModuleTemplate) repository.
